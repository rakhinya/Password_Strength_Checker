A strong password helps prevent unauthorized users from accessing your accounts. Weak passwords are easy to guess or crack, making it simple for attackers to gain access and potentially misuse your data.
Many accounts contain sensitive information, such as personal identification details, financial data, and confidential communications. A strong password helps keep this information safe from cybercriminals.
Identity theft occurs when someone unlawfully obtains and uses your personal information, often for financial gain. Strong passwords make it more difficult for attackers to steal your identity.
Online banking, shopping, and other financial transactions require high levels of security. Strong passwords help protect your accounts from being compromised, which could result in financial losses.
Weak passwords can lead to your accounts being hacked and used to spread malware to others, including your contacts. A strong password helps prevent your account from being used as a tool for cyberattacks.


A password is said to be strong if it satisfies the following criteria:

Tips for Creating and Managing Strong Passwords:
1. Regularly Update Passwords: Change passwords periodically, especially if you suspect any account compromise.
2. Avoid Reusing Passwords: Ensure each of your online accounts has a unique password.
3. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification.
4. Use a Password Manager: Tools like LastPass, 1Password, or Bitwarden can generate strong passwords and store them securely.
